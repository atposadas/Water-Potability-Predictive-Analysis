# Water-Potability-Predictive-Analysis

This group project is an attempt at doing a predictive analysis on testing whether or not water is potable based on the following features:

1. ph: pH of 1. water (0 to 14).
2. Hardness: Capacity of water to precipitate soap in mg/L.
3. Solids: Total dissolved solids in ppm.
4. Chloramines: Amount of Chloramines in ppm.
5. Sulfate: Amount of Sulfates dissolved in mg/L.
6. Conductivity: Electrical conductivity of water in μS/cm.
7. Organic_carbon: Amount of organic carbon in ppm.
8. Trihalomethanes: Amount of Trihalomethanes in μg/L.
9. Turbidity: Measure of light emiting property of water in NTU.
10. Potability: Indicates if water is safe for human consumption. Potable -1 and Not potable 

A variety of methods were used in an attempt to accurately predict the potability of a sample of water in spite of insufficient data, such as different methods of imputation and various supervised and unsuperivsed machine learning models.
